# Discription:
This is the backend of an E-Commerce website. I used Express.js for the server along with  MySQL for the database and Sequelize as the ORM to run SQL models and queries. 
e-commerce sites are big business and need skilled people to run and manage the backend keeping items in stock and priced correctly among many other things.

#User Story:
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
